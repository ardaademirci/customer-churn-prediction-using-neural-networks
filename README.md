# PREDICTING CUSTOMER CHURN USING ARTIFICAL NEURAL NETWROK

Simple model to predict customer churn in the given dataset using TensorFlow.

Very simple and understandable implementation with helpful comments and guides.


Let us take look at the results from the command line and then inspect the graphs.

The summary of our model:
It is made up of 1 input layer, 2 hidden layer and an output layer.

Giving 4 specific customers to the model to see the predictions:

A prediction less than 0.5 means that the model predicts that customer will stay.
We can see here that except the third customer, rest will predicted to stay.

Now the Graphs:

Figure 1 and Figure 2 are different visual representations of the same data.
Their purpose it to give a better understanding of the data.
